# NLP News Summarization

## Overview

News articles provide valuable information, but reading through multiple articles can be time-consuming. Text summarization is a text analysis technique that can automatically summarize long articles into shorter, more manageable summaries. By applying text summarization to news articles, users can quickly get an overview of the news and stay up-to-date with current events. This project aims to develop a text summarization tool for news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
