# NLP News Summarization

## Overview

News articles provide valuable information, but reading through multiple articles can be time-consuming. Text summarization is a text analysis technique that can automatically summarize long articles into shorter, more manageable summaries. By applying text summarization to news articles, users can quickly get an overview of the news and stay up-to-date with current events. This project aims to develop a text summarization tool for news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.


## Features

The NLP News Summarization tool provides the following features:

- **Extractive summarization** : The tool uses extractive summarization techniques to identify the most important sentences in a news article and generate a summary based on those sentences.
- **Abstractive summarization** : The tool uses abstractive summarization techniques to generate a summary that is not a direct extract from the article but instead is paraphrased or rephrased to create a more concise summary.
- **Customizable summarization** : The tool allows users to customize the length of the summary they wish to generate, making it easy to get a summary of any length that meets their needs.
- **Multilingual summarization** : The tool supports summarization of news articles in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese.
- **API access** : The tool provides a simple RESTful API for accessing its summarization functionality programmatically.
